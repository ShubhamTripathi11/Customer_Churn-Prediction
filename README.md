This project predicts customer churn using a machine learning model trained on the Telco Customer Churn dataset. The model is deployed using Streamlit, allowing users to input customer details and get real-time churn predictions.

Features:
Uses a Gradient Boosting Classifier for prediction.

Accepts user inputs via an interactive Streamlit UI.

Preprocesses categorical data for better model accuracy.

Provides real-time churn predictions.

Tech Stack:
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Joblib, Scikit-learn)

Streamlit for web-based UI

Machine Learning (Gradient Boosting Classifier).
